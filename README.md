# ðŸ¤– Prompt Engineering Playground

An interactive Streamlit demo for exploring and evaluating **prompt-based behaviors** of language models â€” no fine-tuning required.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This playground empowers you to:

- ðŸ›  **Modify the Base Prompt**  
  Tweak the core system message that shapes the modelâ€™s behavior.

- ðŸ§¾ **Edit Context (Restaurant Info & Menu)**  
  Change environment data and observe how it influences responses.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Add Few-shot Examples**  
  Guide the model with your own examples to steer its behavior.

- ðŸ§ª **Run Test Cases**  
  Evaluate the model across:
  - Normal order flows
  - Edge cases
  - Prompt-injection attacks

- ðŸ’¬ **Chat with the Assistant**  
  Engage in live conversation using your configured prompt & context.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **No fine-tuning needed** â€” everything is demoed with prompt engineering alone.
- Supports **prompt robustness testing**, including adversarial inputs.
- Great for **researchers, developers**, and anyone interested in LLM limitations and prompt design.
- Completely **open-source** â€” ideal for learning or building prototypes.
