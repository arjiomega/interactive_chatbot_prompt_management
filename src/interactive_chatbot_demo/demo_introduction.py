Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering Playground**!  
This interactive app is designed to help you **explore, experiment, and evaluate** prompt-based behaviors of language models â€” without any fine-tuning involved.

---

### ðŸ›  What You Can Do Here

- ðŸ”§ **Modify the Base Prompt**  
Play around with the core system message that guides the modelâ€™s behavior.

- ðŸ§¾ **Edit the Context (Restaurant Info & Menu)**  
Change the environment and see how the model adapts its response.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Add Fewshot Examples**  
Inject custom examples to steer the model's behavior through few-shot learning.

- ðŸ§ª **Run Test Cases**  
View how the model performs under various customer queries, including:
    - Normal ordering scenarios
    - Edge cases
    - Prompt injection attempts (and how well theyâ€™re handled)

- ðŸ’¬ **Chat with the Assistant**  
Try out your configuration in real-time with a simulated chatbot interface.

---

### ðŸš« No Fine-Tuning Required

This app demonstrates the **power of prompt engineering** alone â€” no model retraining, fine-tuning, or API-level customization needed.

---

### ðŸ¤“ For Developers & Researchers

Great for:
- Testing prompt robustness
- Understanding LLM limitations
- Designing resilient chatbot interfaces
- Evaluating few-shot effectiveness
